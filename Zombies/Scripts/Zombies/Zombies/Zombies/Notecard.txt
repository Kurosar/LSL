// For  JodyLDexler Resident & Klatu Resident


I have a 'zombie' I made for you out of some leftover bits that should be a good start to being zombied.

It has the following animations:

    // stand     - just standing there
    // attack    - it does this when it reaches a random spot
    // left      - left foot forward
    // right     - right foot forward
    // hit       - when someone touches it, this happens
    // bighit    - and then this

Just rez it and touch it.  A short animation 'diagnostic' will run to show you the moves.

It will walk around and roar and wave arms a bit.  It wanders within 10 meters of one spot, you can click it to change the range.se drives around the land and over obstacles.  You probably should set your zombiues to phantokm so thay can pass thru objects.  I prefer mine non-phantom so they bump into things and push people.  The downside is that they can get stuck.  If stuck, they 'step on the gas', until they lag walk thru the object, usually with an overshoot than can shoot them off the sim, Oh well, They are dead, after all.

It also has an ability for you to sit on it, i.e., ride on its back and drive it around.  When you hop off, they walk back to home ( and can get stuck again).  I lose lots of zombies that way.

You can use the scripts to make your own zombies.  They are nothing more than a base, flat prim with something attached and animated.  There are no other scripts in them.

Do not reuse the notecard "Movement' from this zombie in your zombies.  Use a blank notecard called 'Movement'. Blank out the contents or it will destroy your new creation!  It is specific to each prim set size, position, and rotation. You can animate any part of the animal except the base, that b.

There is a help menu for how to make your own animations on my website in the help link in the menu.
