// XS Pet xs_sleep
// :CODE:

// xs_sleep

// Particle plug in for XS_Pets.
// place this in the head of any animal. When it falls asleep, it will spit out Zzzzs
// only use this with xs_animated_eye script, as the xs_two_texture eye script has this built-in

// 9-17-3012 - made it so the eyes black out when sleeping

// tunables:
string texture = "Z";          // Texture used for particles. Texture must be in prim's inventory.
// thanks to Semi Sixpence for spotting this was  'key'
// could be key texture "SOME key copied from inventory but not a name";







// START OF COPIED file 'Global Constants.txt' from the Debug folder.  It has to be the same in all files
// If you change this in any script, change it in all of them, please. It works a lot better that way.
