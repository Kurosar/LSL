The VERSION = 0.51.  

Individual scripts may carry a revision in a comment. I usually carry all revisions via copy and paste of the Global Constants.txt file.

Script Revisions:

Version 0.23 10-3-2011
    Modified code: changed all Link messages to these constants in this file in the Animal (Quail)
    removed the YOUR_UUID and replaced it with llGetCreator() in all scripts.
    xs_foodbowl_animation modified to show food bowl filling for creator only.
    xs_eggcup.lsl - Mod by Ferd removed ban on Ami Pollemis
    xs_home.lsl - Mod by Ferd to listen to HOME_CHANNEL, not -237918, the original src has no other reference to that channel.
