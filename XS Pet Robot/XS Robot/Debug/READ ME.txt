Revision  history is stored in REVISIONS.txt.  
Individual files have revs that show the last thing done to them.

Global Tunable numbers are located in /Debug/Global Constants.txt.
The global file MUST be modifed and copied and pasted into all scripts in the places indicated when you modify an animal.

To recreate a new XS pet or to modify the scripts inside a pet,  you must do them in a certain sequence:

     Rez  the  Homing Object (Flag), Egg (Nut and Bolt), egg cup, (Toolbox), and crate (Transport UFO).  DO NOT rez a Robot.
     Click the create and unpack a Robot
     Reset the scripts in the Robot.
     Delete the "Nut and Bolt" and "Troubot" in the "XS CryoCrate" aka "Transport UFO", and toolbox and any eggs or robots inside "Troubot"

	The pet Troubot should have ONLY a Homing Object (the flag) and the scripts.

     Modify any scripts you wish to modify.
     The pet must have certain scripts running or it will die and delete the scripts. There is a new switch thaty turns off this behavious, but it happens with old scripts.
     If it dies, replace the scripts and reset the xs_brain script.

     Take a copy of the "Nut and Bolt" Egg
     Put the copy inside the Spaceship and and the Transport UFO. Do not put one in your pet Troubot!   It will get a copy of itself and an egg from the UFO or Toolbox or Egg.

     Take a copy of the FRESHLY RESET  Robot. This will not work with a living one, so reset the Robot and take a copy.
     Put the copy inside the crate and the egg cup
     Put the copy inside the Spaceship and and the Transport UFO

     Rez the copied Nut and Bolt.  It should change color.
     Click the Nut and Bolt and package it.  The Toolbox will rename itself "Toolbox: S:0 G:0% <0.00,1.00,0.00>/<0.00,1.00,0.00>"
     You may store the Toolbox in your inventory
     The Nut and Bolt egg inside the Toolbox  is ready to be hatched.

	  Make sure you have the Home Object (Flag) rezzed and nearby.
     It MUST have a number in the description that is the distance the pet will wnder within.

     Click the toolbox and unpack it. A Nut and Bolt will re-appear
     Click the Nut and Bolt and hatch it. A Robot will appear.
     It should move.  If it does not move, check your Home Flag!

     Touch the Robot for a menu
     Click the Package Option
     The Spaceship will change to the pet colors and the Robot will disappear.
     The Spaceship will rename itself to "Transport UFO: Troubot"

    You may store the crate in your inventory

    Click the "Transport UFO" Spaceship
    Click Unpack and your Robot will live again

    Take a copy of the xs_cryocrate to inventory.
    Unpack the pet.

    Reset all scripts in the pet
    Take copy of the pet to inventory.  This is the new, reset  pet that goes in the xs_cryocrate and xs_eggcup.
    Stop all scripts in pet
    Take copy of stopped pet to inventory. I use this to work on future pets as it can be rezzed without whining. Just start the scripts up.
    Rez the saved xs_cryocrate again.
    Replace the pet with the reset pet from your inventory
    Shift-Copy this package
    Reset the scripts in this xs_cryocrate.

    Put a copy of the new, reset pet in the xs_eggcup and take to inventory as the new xs_eggcup


/////////////////////// NOTES ////////////////////

Breeding:
    A male will be capable of breeding at 7 days age. maxAge variable
    A male will look for a female to breed with every 3 hours
    A female will be capable of breeding at 7 days age.
    Breeding begins when the timer in the xs_breeding script times out 7 days after birth, plus every 3 hours.
    The male bird will chat that he has a gleam in his eye
    The male timer broadcasts a LINK_SEEK_FEMALE
    The male xs_brain hears this and send a chat message of MALE_BREED_CALL
    A female that hears this will trigger a LINK_MALE_BREED_CALL
    The link message will cause her to "blushes then bobs her head up and down"
    This triggers a LINK_SIGNAL_ELIGIBLE
    The female chats back a FEMALE_ELIGIBLE
    A male that hears this checks to see if they share the same Home location
    The male then triggers a LINK_FEMALE_ELIGIBLE
    The male remembers the mothers ID, then sends a LINK_CALL_MALE
    The male says a MALE_ON_THE_WAY to the female
    The female checks that the makle is heading to her
    The female then sends the link message LINK_MALE_ON_THE_WAY
    The female then sends the chat message FEMALE_LOC with her coordinates
    The female then sets a timeout of 20 minutes for the male to get to her
    The female then stops moving for 15 minutes
    If the male fails to mate within that time, the female sends a LINK_BREED_FAIL
    The female then broadcasts a BREEDING_FAIL and the breeding has ended
    If the male hears the FEMALE_LOC, it triggers a LINK_FEMALE_LOCATION
    The male then remembers the location and sets sex_dest
    When the male reaches that position, he sends a LINK_RQST_BREED
    If another male has not yet impregnated her, she sends a LINK_CALL_MALE_INFO
    The male responds with MALE_INFO with his breeding characteristics
    This triggers two actions: a chatted MALE_INFO and a LINK_MALE_INFO
    The female remembers the male info and becomes pregnant

    A female will be pregnant for 48 hours (2 days), then lay an egg
    A female can get pregnant again in 5,000 seconds, or 1.39 hours


Eating:
    Animals scan for a food bowl every 30 minutes, +/- 30 seconds, controlled by FOOD_BOWL_SCAN_INTERVAL in xs_brain
    Animals get hungry in 4 hours
    if hungry, they eat every hour


Specials:
   Xs_special script is for adding text to an animal to make it a special.   You change in the xs_egg script the string :

      string SPECIAL = "Normal";

   to come other string.  This string is saved in the egg cup and pet crate.
   The string will be sent to xs_special.  What you do with it is up to you.
