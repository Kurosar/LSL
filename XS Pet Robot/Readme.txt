This is the XS Pets project.  The original scripts by Xundra Snowpaw have been reverse engineered into a working Quail, and now, a Robot. 

The original XS Pet Quail code is in the Xundra Snowpaw directory. I do not recommend that you use it as it is extremely specific to a particular Quail.

The 'XS Quail modified' folder holds a version that is much easier to work on, but is still very Quail-specific.  You can use it to make other pets, by hand-editing some constants and variables, as it expects certain names to be used and the prim ordering is very specific.

The 'Robot' folder contains Troubot the Robot.   This code is as generic as I can make it, so the scripts can be used in a Quail, robot, or any other pet you make.  

Instructions and additional tools are in the Debug folder.  I have included textures and scripts for several variations, and in the Debug folder are notes and test scripts to help debug changes that you may make. If you see something missing, please report it back to me so that others can benefit.

This has taken me hundreds of hours to recreate, and then even more modify to be more generic.  Dozens of people have given me feedback so we can improve on these pets.  Please send your feedback, bug reports and add-ons and fixes - the best way is to email me, fred@mitsi.com, or post comments on the web site http://free-lsl-scripts.com in the specific section.

The original code is licensed as GNU open source.   This pretty much means you may do almost anything you want with those scripts. 

My additions ( some plug-ins ) are licensed as "Creative Commons Attribution/NonCommercial/Share Alike", which means you cannot sell the scripts or the project. I am granting an exemption so that you are allowed to make your own pets and sell them with the scripts included.  You may create your own proprietary extensions but my scripts must be "Share-Alike", and the source must always be available upon request.
