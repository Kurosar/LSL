// XS Pet plug in for particle effects when a pet lays an egg.
// :CODE:


//// plug in for particle effects when a pet lays an egg.
// You can look at my script library at http://outworldz.com/cgi/freescripts.plx?Category=Particles  for particle subroutines.
//  Just be sure that whatever subroutine you use, it is named "startParticles()".
// To mix particles together and have more than one effect, you have to put a script in additional prims.
// Change the particle effect, and put this script in different child prims, as each prim can have only one particle emitter.


// you can change this next line
float SECONDS = 5.0;    // how long to play the effect before it is shut off

// this message is sent by xs_brain when she lays an egg. A Global Constant in the XS Pets. Don't mess with it.
integer LINK_LAY_EGG = 970;             // Rez Object(Egg...

// this next function makes the particles.
// change this function to any particle effect you want.

// this is a well-documented particle subroutine by Xah Lee from

 // The pattern EXPLODE is good for fireworks. The DROP would be good for water drops. The PATTERN_ANGLE will burst particles in a pie-shape in the x-plane. Good for example for rainbow. ANGLE_CONE is a cone along the z-axes, good for example for jet exhaust, or water fountain. ANGLE_CONE_EMPTY is like ANGLE_CONE, but where ANGLE_CONE shoots, ANGLE_CONE_EMPTY will not.

 | PSYS_PART_BOUNCE_MASK

// The PSYS_PART_FOLLOW_SRC_MASK makes the emitted particle's positions follow the emiter (disables PSYS_SRC_BURST_RADIUS). If not set, then particles once emitted outside of the PSYS_SRC_BURST_RADIUS will flow by themselves.
