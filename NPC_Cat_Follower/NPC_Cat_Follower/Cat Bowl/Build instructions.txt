// INSTRUCTIONS for KITTEH KAT FUD BOWL
// :CODE:

-------------------------------------------------------
To make either of these these cats, you must first make a avatar and a cat food bowl.   You also have to have NPC's enabled on your land.  

See http://opensimulator.org/wiki/OSSLNPC

Upload the Cat1.dae file.     Give the model a name such as "Kitteh Kat", and select the pulldown for "Avatar Shape" on the Level of Detail screen.

Physics can be set to Lowest- or anything since this is a NPC, it will be ignored. But you may want a static model, so Lowest will work best then.

You must select the two switches on the upload tab for  Include Skin Weight and Include Joint Positions boxes.

Texture it, and wear the cat.

Go to "Me"->Appearance so we can get rid of our old body with an Alpha Layer

Edit appearance:  Click the little gear at the bottom of the Edit Appearance window and select New->Alpha Layer.

Locate the Alpha Tab and click all of the check boxes for the alpha boxes. 

Save this as "Kat Alpha".

Take everything you are wearing off except the cat.

With a 100% alpha, you will look like a cat with the arms crossed. 

Now edit your shape.   At the borttom of the first shape screen is a setting for avatar offset.    Add an offset to your avatar so the rear legs are on the ground.   I also shorten the legs and lengthen the arms to the maximum so that all 4 feet are on the ground.  Save this appearance at "Kitteh Kat  shape".

You can also upload Katt2.dae and it's tail and texture it separately.

Anims:

The anims go in a box or circular cat bowl with the main script.    I put some water in my cat bowl using a script from a waterfall, but that is optional.

Upload the animations  "Stand.bvh and "Walk.bvh". Upload them with 'loop' checked.     If you play them, you should be standing there, or walking. 

The file "claw.anim" and "meow.anim" is "bulk uploaded" and it goes in the same bowl.   Put all of them in the bowl and name these  "Meow", "Claw", "Stand", and "Walk".

Add the NPC_Cat_Follower script to the box or cat fud bowl. (Cat fud is the correct spelling for kitteh kat fud bowls", according to  teh Internets).

Upload and add all the sounds and put them in the same box.

Now take the cat and tail off, and put it back on again. (Very Necessary as this saves the attachment point).

Then click the box and select "Appearance" from the menu.  This will make the notecard for your Grid.   Then click "Start".

A cat should appear and follow you around.

Cat bowls made this way work on a single grid. To go to another grid requires that the notecard be recreated for each grid.

KTHXBYE
