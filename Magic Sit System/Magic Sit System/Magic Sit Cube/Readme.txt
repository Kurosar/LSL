I. Presentation

Magic Sit System is the new easy way to configure sit targets on your chairs, beds, cars, rocks, walls, ...

No need of maths nor calculation scripts. This is the free and lagless alternative to the charmless poseballs.

II. Why you should not use poseballs

If you just want to allow residents to sit on your object, each new poseball adds an
unnecessary script to the simulator and therefore generates lag.

Each poseball adds a new prim to your object, diminishing your allowed
prims count and generating lag.

Poseballs are not natural to use, they are a convention.

Poseballs are not aesthetical.

III. How to use the Magic Kit

1) Put the script named "Magic Sit Script" into the object you want to configure
2) Rez the "Magic Sit Cube"
3) Sit on the cube (left click is enough)
4) Right-click on the cube and select "Edit" in the pizza menu that appears
5) Move and rotate the cube until your avatar is in the desired position
6) Unsit


To test the result, just sit on your object (left click should be enough).

At the end, the script named "Magic Sit Script" is automatically removed
from your object. You can remove the cube as well, or use it to set the
sit target of another object.

IV. Support for multiple sit targets

If you want several sit positions on your object (bank, couch...), repeat the above
sequence for the same number of prims in the object, using the "Edit linked parts"
checkbox.

V. Support for custom animations

Just drop your animation into the object befor you start the above sequence.

When you have finished setting the sit target, you can leave the animation
in the object and add a script to play that anymation when someone sits on your
object, for example the "Magic Anim Script" included in this kit.

There's no support for multiple animations at this time.
