<h1>Home Security  Prim Documentation</h1>

<h2><span editable="true" id="PageTitle">Setup
</span></h2>

<h3>Using Menus
</h3>

&nbsp; 
Most people will want to use the menus to do the HS Prim installation.<br>
&nbsp; Just click SET UP on the HS Prim's menu and ignore the rest of this
page.
<h3>Linden Home residents and similar</h3>
<p>
Linden Home residents (and people with similar style properties) should chose from the HomeSecurity Prim menu:
<ul>
<li>SETUP</li>
<li>Basic</li>
<li>Read the few instructions/questions and respond to them if needed.</li><p>
    <ul>
    <li><b>Operators</b> - You do not have to add extra Operators. You have been added automatically.</li>
    <li><b>Visitors</b> - You can add your friends avatar names to the list by typing in chat: <font color="green">/8addf persons.name</font>
    <li><b>Targets</b> - You do not have to add any Targets.
    <li><b>Attack Type</b> - You need to choose how to treat unwanted people:<p>
	<ul>
	<li><i><b>Eject</b></i> - sends them outside but they might still annoy you from just outside your house.
	<li><i><b>Teleport</b></i> - sends them all the way home away from you.
	<li><i><b>Push</b></i> - gives them a nudge away. This is usually a gentle friendly attack. (Not recommended)
	</ul><p>
    </ul>
<li>Click TurnOn</li>
<li>Click Guests. Your HS Prim is now removing anyone not on the Guests or Friends list within the Prim</li>
<li>Click TurnOff on the main menu to stop this any time.
</ul>
Don't be scared to explore the menus and try things. You can always follow these instructions again to put things back to default.

<h3>Using Notecards</h3>

This is useful when you are setting up multiple HS Prims with the same
settings.<br>

<br>

You can edit the Settings and Channel notecards in your HS Prim and then
type the command <span style="color: rgb(0, 153, 0);">/8reset</span>
to force the HS Prim to re-read the notecards.<br>

<br>

The command <span style="color: rgb(0, 153, 0);">/8reset</span> will
not cause the Prim to forget names in its memory.<br>

<br>

The current default Settings Notecard for Version 12.000 onwards is
called <span style="color: rgb(51, 102, 255); font-style: italic;">HomeSecurity
Settings 9.000</span> and looks like this:<small><small><br>
