Tandy the Jewel Fairy needs your help! A demon has been sexting her with nasty chat messages and chasing her around the virtual worlds. She had a night-mare, caught it and rode the mare away, and is now hiding in my computer. She needs an Ogre like you to rescue her from my virtual world, and bring her to yours.  But first you have to agree that this is Open Source!


LINDA KELLIE LICENSE AGREEMENT

I don't really care what you do with my creations or how you do it. I will never file a DMCA on anything I have ever made. I really just want people to have the freedom of having something with no rules, no TOS, and no fears.
