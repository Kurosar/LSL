// :DESCRIPTION:
// The Sensor Script - put this script and your 10 second wav file clips into a prim.  Anyone approaching this prim will trigger the music to play for just that avatar./ The avatar must wear a headset or HUD prim with the player script.
// :CODE:
// general purpose avatar sensor for the music playert
// When someone gets in range, this starts the music sequence
// if used in HUD mode, only the avatar wearing the HUD and also in range of some location can hear the sounds/music.
// When used in PRIM mode, anyone standing near will trigger the sound.
