Glad that you've got your copy of the prim skirt builder. First a couple of words why it appeared. 

There's a person who makes my SL the most enjoyable experience, and her name is Vint Falken. 

She is a great SL photo-artist  (if you can afford the price for the services of a professional - then she's the right person to talk to), and a great person overall.

Looking at the LoopRez script which is used for these things, I said "what a boring work it must be!" and told her I can make something better than that.

And then I've decided to release this as full-mod under GPL license, for a few reasons:

        1) I think it is a nice way to express myself to her

        2) I am curious if anyone likes the tool enough that they would tip me without being required to do so :-)

        3) other people (you!) can save some time not spent on boring things and spend it more productively.
        
        4) Last but not least... I depend a lot on the GPL code IRL - and I wanted to contribute back, even in such a small extent.

Now that you've read the story and you know why - grab the manual (you can find a copy of it  inside the posing stand) and look through it - and then... have fun!! :-)

Take also your time to read the EULA and the GPL license - before asking any questions or tweaking any of the permissions :-)

I will post the relevant news regarding this tool on my blog http://daltonic.blogspot.com/ under the tag "primskirtbuilder"

cheers,
Dalien

P.S. Be sure also to visit Vint's blog at http://www.vintfalken.com/ - she has quite a few nice tutorials

P.P.S. if someone sold you this build for anything other than L$0, or if you can not view the source of the scripts - please go and report them, they've been doing so in violation of GPL.
