// Verify_Item_Received_when_rezzed
// :CODE:
Somebody posted some scripts recently that will send an email when an item is rezzed in world another will send an email when an item is unpacked. Not sure if I found this on Xstreet or someone else's site but this is what was there, haven't tested it yet might help you if they work.

My Apologies for not having the script writers name.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
okay - i think my first time posting code, so sorry if i get this messy the first couple tries...
after what seems to be a standing ovation of indifference... i am posting open-source my latest .
product packaging. i've yet to fully install this in my own inventory, but tests so far seem to work
out.

used in a packed-up product prim (three times fast!),
-zPackaging offers some helpful floating text for the customer, if they're newbish.
it also triggers off calls in two other (completely optional) scripts...
-PackagingReceipt1 (which sends a 'rezzed' email when the package is dragged out of the user's
inventory), and
-PackagingReceipt2 (which sends its email message when the prim is unpacked).

this uses three scripts primarily to make up for email's scriptlag.
(additionally, as i only wish to receive each notice only once, each receipt script will
delete itself after use.)

// -zPackaging

// package 'phones home' (emails message)
// 1) email on-rez - would apply to attachement or ground rez i think - great
// 2) email on inventory change - will this work upon avi unpacking a set?? - even better!!
// INVENTORY CHANGE DOES NOT TRIGGER on open/copy to inventory! so, use a timer. :\

// my own touch-controlled transfer, instead of prim-open?
// CANNOT USE llGiveInventoryList instead of open/copy or contents drag, 'cuz that seems restricted to full-perm stuff.

// this script can act as a standalone for floating text handling; just remove one or the other (or both) receipt scripts if you don't want to use them.

// this scripts are DISARMED by default for the creator to use and modify - no email will be sent; scripts will not self-destruct. only when the prim changes hands to a different owner will they activate. (i have some test booleans, but the logics may need cleaned up for them to work.)

// all three scripts should be set to no modify, copy, no transfer to work properly. (copy scripts prevents them from being removed before completing their process.

// ALTHOUGH THESE ARE INTENDED FOR OPEN-SOURCE, DO NOT RELEASE MODIFIABLE COPIES OF YOUR PACKAGED RECEIPT SCRIPTS!! you may be giving away whichever email address you are using included in the script. when exchanging copies, be sure your email address is deleted!!

// 071001 - NEW!! patching in Cubey Terra's ingenious 'detach if worn' script. very handy, and saves me all that nasty extra floating text i use...

//these are the 'most important' vars to change; read the script to change any scriptnames or linkmessage num hooks.
